This is the website of Espartaco Palma, Staff Software Engineer.

Here I'll be posting some technical information, some rants and
things I've learnt in my 20+ years of experience in the Tech industry.

This website is createad using a Static Site Generator called [Hugo][hugo]
and deployed with the state of the art of security: [scp][scp] and [rsync][rsync]

For this new version I have few goals in mind:

  - [Secure for visitors](/privacy/)
  - I must own all the data, no 3rd party or free services.
  - It should be fast enough (< 500 ms per page)
  - No Javascript (it's not you, it's me, JS).
  - It should support cool things like HTTP/2.
