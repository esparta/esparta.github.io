title: "This place"

This place is done with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio) and deployed with
the state of the art of security: scp/rsync

For this new version I have few goals in mind:

  - [Secure for visitors](/privacy/)
  - I must own all the data, no 3rd party or free services.
  - It should be fast enough (< 50 ms per page)
  - No Javascript (it's not you, it's me, JS).
  - It should support cool things like HTTP/2.
