## Context

Back in June 2018 I [posted a tweet][tuit], half joking:

![Twitter Status][img_tw_status_01]

The above tweet mention a 'leaked list' of companies that [Microsoft][ms] would
be willing to buy:

- [x] LinkedIn
- [x] Github
- [ ] NPM
- [ ] Docker Inc.
- [ ] Stackoverflow
- [ ] Travis CI
- [ ] RedisLabs
- [ ] Elastic.co

It was triggered by the [acquisition of][ms_github] [Github][github] that same
day in June 4, 2018. That was a US $7,500,000,000 dollars deal. Not bad. Not bad
at all.

I was trying to make a point: what would be next steps for a company with
the political and financial power like Microsoft to dominate the technology
ecosystem again[^1]?

When I did post that tweet it looked very obvious and also absurd, so I though it
was ridiculous. It would never happen in **that way**. Would it?

## Reality is more absurd than fiction?
![March 16, 2020. Github acquires NPM][img_gh_npm]

Moving forward to March 16, 2020, it happened. [Microsoft][gh_npm] [bought][ms_npm] [NPM Inc][npm],
it may be was a coincidence, may be no. But it was funny 2 months ago, so [I did
tweet again][tuit_02]:

![Almost 2 years ago I predict @Microsoft would be adquiring @npmjs. So, I guess @Docker is next.][img_tw_status_02]

So, Microsoft **was actually willing** to acquire NPM[^2], exactly as I
did predict via that joke in 2018. If the trending was the same, I continue,
then [Docker][docker] would be next.

I'm not even close to be a financial strategist, not at all, I was writing
something ridiculous, way to much ridiculous that it would not happen. Doesn't it?

## Ridiculous, you say? How about this?

OK, it's now May 27, 2020. There's now [press releases][ms_docker] and
[discussions][hn_ms_docker] all over the nerdland:

![Docker expands relationship with Microsoft to ease developer experience across
platforms][img_docker_expand]

> Docker expands relationship with Microsoft to ease developer experience across
> platforms

Is not clear enough? I *was right*. Again. The next in line was Docker,
it may not be an acquisition[^3], but the plans are there and ridiculous as they
seem it may continue in the near future.

## So, StackOverflow is next?
![StackOverflow. We <3 people who code][img_stackoverflow]

I don't know, folks. But I'm not able to think in one single developer who
doesn't use at least once a week StackOverflow to solve an issue at hand.
All, **ALL of us use StackOverflow**, and it may be very convenient that 
Microsoft o any other subsidiary have the control[^4]. It may even take more, like
going directly against [StackExchange][stackexchange], why not?

![StackExchange. The world's largest programming community][img_stackexchange]

Not sure it will be an acquisition, a merge, a takeover. I would guess [Joel
Spolsky][joel] (and their board of directors) would be very happy to sell[^5],
I would sell it. Twice.

## And what about the others?

- [Travis CI][travisci]? Nahh, it would definitely will not happen. I wrote that tweet
  months before [Github Actions was announced][gh_actions_announce], nobody knew
  Github was having a direct competitor to TravisCI. So, no.
- [Redis Labs][redislab]? If I were Microsoft, I will buy it, for sure.
- [Elastic.co][elastico]? Yes, it may be incorporate to Azure. And Bezos will be furious!

## Conclusions

All of these thinking and *coincidences* are kind of funny, but I've seen people
with real concerns about it. I've read in the orange website[^6] that all those
movements are the same strategy [Microsoft had in the 90s][eee]:

> Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish

I'm on the idea this it is not the case.

Microsoft is not the same it used to be. All these acquisitions, collaborations
and future merges does not happen with the goal of extinguish the others,
but to have more participation[^7] of a section of the ecosystem. In my opinion,
it's not a bad thing *per se*

The world is not the same either.

The persons who worked on their own projects and later success[^8] companies
deserves their own goals be completed, growing or compensation that may not be
achieved directly, selling is not a sin.

> Selling is not an end.

Also, there's enough space to cohabit the developers world, Open Source options,
independent communities and foundations, you name it.

Is the future as ridiculous as it may looks?
Not sure. I'm not sure.
