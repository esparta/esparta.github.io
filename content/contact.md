There's several place where you can contact me:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/esparta) or
  [Mastodon](http://ruby.social/@esparta)
- On email: esparta@ [tutanota dot com](https://tutanota.com)
- [Keybase](http://keybase.io/esparta)

My google email is still open, but I suggest to start using any of the above
lines of contact, they are on ascending  _Security Level_ order,
from: "I don't care" to "This is super secret" level.
