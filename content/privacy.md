![privacy][privacy]

A lot of things has change since the inception of the internet,
the place we used to _browse_ is not the same it used to be. What we do with
the ubiquos nodes conected really matter, our privacy matters. **A lot**.

I didn't intent it, but turns out this site complies with the GDPR!

- [HTTPS by default](#https-by-default)
- [No trackers](#no-trackers)
- [No logs](#no-logs)
- [No Cookies](#no-cookies)
- [Terms of Service](#terms-of-service)

I try to keep my own privacy far for bad actors, but I also want
to the future visitors the best experience with their own privacy
even if they don't realize what's happening.

###  HTTPS by default

There's a lot of bad things it can happen while you navigate with your
browser, [HTTPS][https] is one of the foundations of your privacy. I recommend
to read Kevin's blog about it: [Why HTTPS Is Important][https_important].

With HTTPS your connection is kept private between your browser and the
webserver who's serving the web page(s), no persons nor corporations are
able of see the data in transit (including user/passwords). That's good.

But also, it guarantees the integrity of what the person who create the
webpage meant to communicate. Without HTTPS your ISP provider can even
inject any kind of data on the page, modify it, or do whatever they want
since the connection is not secured.

### No trackers

Non. Zero. Nada.
I would never again will add Facebook or Twitter or Instagram widgets buttons.
They are trackers on disguise!

### No logs

I don't store logs on the server side [^1]

### No Cookies

I can prove that!

![cookie_metrix][cookie_metrix_image]

[CookieMetrix][cookie_metrix] has the report so you can review it.

### Terms of Service

I'll try to make it simple: I'm asumming you are here because something is
interesting to you but you don't have to be agree with me, nor sign nothing
at all.
